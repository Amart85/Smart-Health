<b>Instructions</b></br>

* read about human cough types - dry and wet, volunatry/ involuntary, etc. (reference: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9175986). Why cough is an important biomarker for respiratory disease? Do cough frequency vary with disease severity?
* Select a sound classification dataset containing cough/ lungs/ heart sound e.g. ESC-50 dataset https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50 </br>
* make a new dataset with human cough sounds in one class and 4 other types of sounds e.g. sneezing, door knocking, raining, dog barking etc. in another class </br>
* listen to the sounds and visualize some instances using the software Audacity https://www.audacityteam.org/ </br>
* label the target class audio records as cough and the other class audio records as not cough (reference: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336011335_Efficient_Online_Cough_Detection_with_a_Minimal_Feature_Set_Using_Smartphones_for_Automated_Assessment_of_Pulmonary_Patients </br>
* develop a cough classification model and evaluate the model performance </br>
